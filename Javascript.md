Javascript Tech Interview Quetinos


1. Var ,Let, Const

In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare variables: var, let, and const.

ðŸ”¹ var
Function-scoped

Allows redeclaration
Gets hoisted (moved to the top of its scope), but not initialized
Can lead to unexpected behavior, so it's rarely used in modern code.

ðŸ”¹ let
Block-scoped
Can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope
Also hoisted, but not initialized â€” accessing it before declaration causes a ReferenceError

ðŸ”¹ const
Block-scoped like let
Must be initialized at declaration
Cannot be reassigned (but if itâ€™s an object or array, you can mutate the contents)


example 1) 
function test() {
  console.log(a); // undefined (hoisted)
  // console.log(b); // ReferenceError
  // console.log(c); // ReferenceError

  var a = 1;
  let b = 2;
  const c = 3;
}


#2 What is hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope before code is executed.

This applies to:

var declarations
Function declarations (but not expressions)

let and const are hoisted too, but they stay in a "temporal dead zone", meaning you canâ€™t use them until they are declared.

Hoisting can lead to bugs, bad for readbility, incocististne behavior

Best way avoid var, and ust Let and const
