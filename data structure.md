ðŸŒ² What is a Tree (Data Structure)?
A Tree is a hierarchical data structure made up of nodes, where:

The top node is called the root

Each node can have children

Thereâ€™s only one path between the root and any node (no cycles)

It's like a family tree or folder structure.




ðŸŒ³ What is a B-Tree?
A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure used to store sorted data and allow fast searches, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time (O(log n)).


A B-Tree is a sorted, balanced tree where each node can have many children.
Itâ€™s optimized for fast read/write operations, especially in systems like databases and file systems.
